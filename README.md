***WARNING: Work in progress, is undergoing a massive deconstruction/reconstruction***

I made this soft a while back and elcerdo decided to port it to github with slight modifications. 
He said that thanks to his changes it no longer works, i must take some times to bring it back in a usable state ;)

It is a simple software I made to learn more about ray tracing. 

The scene consist of 4 sphere, rendered in ray-tracing, 2 are moving and you can control one using your mouse. Lots of reflection (each shpere reflect the light) .
It was pretty nice.

Use SDL to get a drawing buffer and receive keystrokes, C++ (from when I didn't exactly knew what I was doing, so beware)
